## Usage

<p align="center">
  
   
  
</p>

<h4>Relocatable allows users to search for cities, input their salary, and to see their cost of living there. Relocatable was designed mobile-first with functionality, responsiveness, and a smooth user experience at the forefront.

<h3>MVP (Minimum Viable Product):</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Use React Router to make routes on the SPA</li>
    <li>Lift up state between input and form components, writing parent state to redux store</li>
    <li>Making multiple API calls to populate view page</li>
    <li>Responsive design on all devices</li>
</ul>

</br>

<h3>Stretch Goals Completed</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Further dividing the Numbeo API results into subcategories, and displaying these results in their own components</li>
    <li>Animating components mounting and unmounting</li>
    <li>Adding an About page</li>
</ul>
